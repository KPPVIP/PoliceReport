Update:

It is necessary to delete the policereports table in the database.

* It is now possible to place multiple coordinates for the npc and computer.

* Now the player will have to wait a predetermined time to make a new report.

* If a player has already made a report and then makes another report, 
the previous one will be deleted. 
That is, there will only be one police report per player. 
This will make it more organized.

* Now NPC is imortal
